# CKY Algorithm for CFG and PCFG Parsing

This project implements the CKY algorithm for parsing context-free and probabilistic context-free grammars (CFG and PCFG). The goal is to build a parser that checks sentence membership and retrieves parse trees from a given grammar. The parser uses a pre-established ruleset and around 1000 test sentences for a corpus.

## Key Features
- **Grammar Validation**: Ensures the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
- **CKY Parsing**: Implements the CKY algorithm to check if a sentence can be generated by the grammar.
- **Probabilistic Parsing**: Finds the most probable parse tree using a PCFG.
- **Parse Tree Retrieval**: Reconstructs the most probable parse tree from the backpointer table.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Run the parser**:
   ```bash
   python cky.py
